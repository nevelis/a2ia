## Architecture Overview
The management (mgmt) layer defines and owns the canonical network topology, including VPC supernet, subnet configuration, and routing. This configuration is the single source of truth for all other environments.

The key architectural rule: **dependency flows downward**. The mgmt layer exports its topology through Terraform outputs, and all other environments (substrate, dev, prod) consume these outputs through a `data.terraform_remote_state` data source.

        +------------------------+
        |        mgmt layer      |
        |  (defines topology)    |

        +------------------------+
        |     substrate layer     |
        |  (consumes topology)    |
        +------------------------+
                     |
                     v
        +------------------------+
        |   prod / dev layers     |
        |  (consume topology)     |
        +------------------------+
```

### VPC Module Design
All layers use the same reusable VPC module located at `iac/modules/vpc/`. This module is fully topology-driven and accepts the following key inputs:
- `env`: Environment name (mgmt, substrate, prod, dev)
- `vpc_cidr`: The CIDR block for the VPC
- `subnet_topology`: Map of AZs and tiers for subnets

This module creates subnets, route tables, and associations dynamically, ensuring consistency across all environments.

### Topology Ownership
- **Mgmt:** Uses `local.subnet_map` and `local.supernet_config` directly (authoritative source)
- **Substrate, Dev, Prod:** Use `data.terraform_remote_state.mgmt.outputs.supernet_map` and `.supernet_config`

### Why This Matters
This ensures:
- No circular dependencies
- Homogeneous topology access
- Safe separation of concerns
- Reproducible, deterministic network configuration across all layers

### Topology Brownership
## Development Notes

### Topology Brownership
- **Mgmt:** Uses `local.subnet_map` and `local.supernet_config` directly (authoritative source)
- **Substrate, Dev, Prod:** Use `data.terraform_remote_state.mgmt.outputs.supernet_map` and `.supernet_config`
## Recent Changes
Fixed this bloody thing
**2025-10-24:**
- Implemented shared `iac/modules/vpc` module.
- Refactored mgmt to use `subnet_topology` input variable instead of flat VPC.
- Established canonical topology ownership rules.
- Clarified dependency direction and state access model.
- Next step: validate approach and run full Terraform plan/apply for mgmt layer to confirm expected resources and topology integrity.
