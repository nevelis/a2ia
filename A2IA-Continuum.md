## Active Thread: Filesystem Tools Restoration
**Context:**  
Following the successful reimplementation of `patch_file()` and `truncate_file()`, 20 test failures remain due to missing or outdated filesystem utilities.

**Outstanding Work:**  
- Re-implement the following tools inside `filesystem_tools.py`:  
  - `append_file()`  
  - `edit_file()`  
  - `grep()`  
  - `head()`  
  - `tail()`  
  - `find_replace()`  
  - `prune_directory()`  
- Ensure signatures match test expectations (see `tests/test_new_filesystem_tools.py` and related modules).  

**Immediate Next Steps:**  
1. Parse test failure tracebacks to extract required API signatures and semantics.  
2. Implement `append_file()` and `edit_file()` first (highest test volume).  
3. Validate via TDD loop until all 20 failing tests pass.  
4. Document patterns and utilities for reuse across all MCP tools.  

**Future Considerations:**  
- Consolidate duplicated file-operation logic into reusable workspace helpers.  
- Add unified logging and exception instrumentation to all tools.
