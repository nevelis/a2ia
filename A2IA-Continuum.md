# A2IA Continuum
This document captures ongoing efforts, design deliberations, and current areas of focus within the `a2ia/` subsystem.

---

## Active Threads
### Filesystem Reliability Fixes
**Context:**
The current `filesystem_tools.py` implementation demonstrates unsafe write semantics. Both `append_file` and `truncate_file` need repair and verification.

**Objective:**
Implement safe, atomic, and consistent behavior for both functions under concurrent workspace conditions.

**Approach:**
1. Write failing pytest cases confirming current broken behavior.
2. Refactor implementation:
   - `append_file()` should open file in `'a'` mode and write content safely.
   - `truncate_file()` should create file if it does not exist, then open in `'r+b'` or `'w+b'` as appropriate.
3. Validate fixes via regression testing.

**Status:** Planning / Test Design Stage

---

## Upcoming Tasks
- Review `workspace.py` methods used by filesystem tools to ensure consistent error handling.
- Conduct code review of other file-related tools for atomicity and safety compliance.
- Integrate test results into Chronicle after verification.

---

## Design References
- Follow prior A2IA Codex conventions: documentation-first TDD cycle with immutable chronicle and living continuum.
- Ensure compliance with workspace isolation â€” all paths relative to `a2ia/` root.
- Maintain auditability and minimal side effects.

## Notes
This Continuum evolves alongside the codebase. Upon milestone completion, relevant sections will migrate into the Chronicle.
