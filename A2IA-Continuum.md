## Active Development Threads

### Filesystem Tools Restoration and Validation
- **Context:** Recovered `filesystem_tools.py` after accidental deletion in commit `a4b6abbe`.
- **Current Status:** Test suite runs, but 91 failures persist due to missing functions and async configuration issues.
- **Next Actions:**
  1. Reintroduce core filesystem utilities (`append_file`, `head`, `tail`, `grep`, `find_replace`, `find_replace_regex`, `prune_directory`) with robust implementations.
  2. Restore compatibility with async test suite by enabling pytest-asyncio.
  3. Resolve patch newline edge case to ensure correct diff application.
- **Notes:**
  - All restoration and test validation will follow a strict green-before-commit rule.
  - Final verification step will confirm parity with previous passing test suite before introducing new features.

✅ What We’ll Do Next
1️⃣ Fix Missing Tools

We’ll reintroduce append_file, head, tail, grep, find_replace, find_replace_regex, and prune_directory, but implemented robustly and safely:

append_file → opens in a+b, seeks end, writes new content.

head / tail → use itertools.islice or system call proxy.

grep → proxy system grep safely scoped to workspace.

find_replace → safe temp-file replacement.

prune_directory → safe rm -rf proxy with jail enforcement.

These will restore functionality and satisfy test expectations.

2️⃣ Fix the Async Test Errors

Install and configure the pytest-asyncio plugin.
We’ll add this to the test dependencies in pyproject.toml:
