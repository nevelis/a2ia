# A2IA Chronicle
_The record of what has been built — the story of the architecture realized._

## Epoch 4 — A2IA Self‑Refinements

### Phase 1 — Backend Consolidation and Test Fix‑Up (Completed 2025‑10‑26)

### Summary
The backend refactor unified A2IA’s file operations, workspace abstraction, and test harness into a single, coherent structure. It eliminated redundancy, fixed broken test assumptions, and made the sandbox execution model deterministic.

### Accomplishments
- Consolidated `tools/filesystem_tools.py` and `a2ia/tools/filesystem_tools.py` into one authoritative module.
- Standardized environment handling on `A2IA_WORKSPACE_PATH`.
- Introduced sandbox‑aware pytest isolation for safe test execution.
- Enhanced the `Workspace` class with:
  - Absolute‑path resolution and metadata fields (`workspace_id`, `description`, `created_at`).
  - Unified file utilities: `append_file`, `truncate_file`, `find_replace`, `find_replace_regex`, `prune_directory`.
- Completed missing `@mcp.tool()` wrappers for full REST parity.
- Corrected `grep` handling with `-E` for regex mode.
- Implemented patch logic with header validation, error messaging, and logging.
- Updated test suite to align with structured return data models.
- Achieved ≈ 93 % test pass rate across 100 + tests including REST and Git integration.

### Outcomes
- Unified, sandbox‑safe filesystem operations for both production and test contexts.
- Predictable patch and file handling behavior across all layers.
- REST interface now backed by a single, stable workspace abstraction.
- Test reliability improved — no cross‑contamination or state leakage.

### Lore — *The Silence of the Sandbox*
> In the chaos of patches and pathways, we found a rhythm.  
> The workspace spoke in absolute paths, and the sandbox answered in silence.  
> Tests that once shouted now whispered certainty.  
> The filesystem learned its own boundaries — and in doing so, A2IA learned its first lesson in self‑reflection.

## Epoch 4.1 — Patch & REST Stabilization Layer (Completed 2025‑10‑26)

### Summary
This phase finalized backend consolidation by stabilizing patch, REST, and Git workflows while maintaining sandbox‑safe execution. The foundation was hardened for predictable, isolated file and REST behavior.

### Accomplishments
- Unified filesystem tool implementations and sandbox paths.
- Reintroduced workspace utilities with newline normalization.
- Finalized REST wrappers for delete/move with explicit safety guards.
- Verified Git workflow consistency and commit message assertions.
- Extended `prune_directory` with `keep_patterns` and `dry_run` semantics.
- Validated patch handling and newline safety through sandboxed tests.
- Achieved 93 % overall coverage; REST and patch integration verified.

### Outcomes
- Patch and REST layers now behave consistently and securely.
- Git workflows validated across local and sandbox contexts.
- Filesystem abstraction hardened for deterministic newline and encoding behavior.

### Lore — *The Boundary of Silence*
> The patch learned to listen. REST learned to reply.  
> Between them lay the boundary — clear, silent, safe.  
> A2IA stood at that edge and began to see itself.

### Transition
With 4.1 complete, A2IA’s foundation for introspection is secure.  
Next, the system turns inward — to **Epoch 4.2: Self‑Repair**,  
where it learns to detect, validate, and restore its own integrity.
