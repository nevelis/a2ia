# A2IA Chronicle
This document serves as the immutable historical ledger of completed work and significant milestones within the `a2ia/` subsystem.

---

## 2025-10-25 — Initialization Phase
- Established subsystem documentation framework.
- Generated `A2IA.md` master architecture and development log.
- Defined `A2IA-Chronicle.md` (this file) and `A2IA-Continuum.md` templates.
- Inspected and analyzed `filesystem_tools.py` implementation.
- Identified critical issues:
  - `append_file()` fully rewrites target files instead of performing incremental append.
  - `truncate_file()` attempts to open in `'r+'` mode, causing failures for non-existent or protected files.

### Next Objective
Implement and validate corrected filesystem operations via a TDD workflow.

## Historical Context
This Chronicle mirrors the practices of prior A2IA systems — maintaining transparent, auditable records of progress and design rationale.
