### [2025-10-26] â€” Patch & Truncate Restoration
**Commit:** 8e3e4cb  
**Summary:** Implemented robust `patch_file()` and `truncate_file()` tools with full sandboxed testing.  

**Details:**  
- Rewrote `patch_file()` to operate workspace-relative with proper `cwd`.  
- Added newline-safety to patch temp files.  
- Eliminated recursion caused by local import of `subprocess`.  
- Confirmed with four comprehensive sandboxed patch tests (all passed).  
- `truncate_file()` rewritten to correctly create/truncate safely within workspace.  
- 20 tests still failing due to missing filesystem tools (`append_file`, `edit_file`, `grep`, `head`, `tail`, `find_replace`, `prune_directory`, etc.).  

**Next:** Begin restoration of missing filesystem tools per `A2IA-Continuum.md`.
