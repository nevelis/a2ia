## Epoch 4.2 — PyTest Stabilization & Deterministic Toolchain (Active)

**Objective:**  
Achieve full and consistent pytest reliability by eliminating nondeterministic behavior in all file and workspace tools (`EditFile`, `AppendFile`, `Truncate`, `PatchFile`).  This phase represents A2IA’s *true self-repair* — repairing its toolchain from within to ensure deterministic, testable, and self-consistent behavior.

### Roadmap Timeline
- [x] Complete REST and patch stabilization groundwork (from Epoch 4.1).  
- [ ] Diagnose current pytest instability (capture failure matrix).  
- [ ] Isolate nondeterministic tool behaviors in file operations.  
- [ ] Refactor file I/O logic to pure read→modify→write cycles.  
- [ ] Rebuild and validate patch safety and newline normalization.  
- [ ] Execute full pytest suite, verify 100% deterministic outcomes.  
- [ ] Harden test harness to detect race or state leakage.  
- [ ] Update Chronicle and A2IA.md upon stabilization confirmation.

### Current Context
**Date:** 2025-10-26  
**Workspace:** `/home/aaron/a2ia-dev`  
**Coverage:** ~93% passing, intermittent file-related failures  
**Focus:** Deterministic file I/O and pytest stabilization  

The sandbox environment and tool integrations are complete; remaining work centers on ensuring pytest passes reliably across all tool actions, validating consistency across runs, and enforcing determinism in every file mutation.

---

### Key Design Intentions
- **Determinism First:** Every tool must produce identical output for identical inputs.  
- **Safe File Semantics:** Use atomic read→modify→write flows only.  
- **No Legacy Calls:** Deprecate EditFile/PatchFile behaviors relying on partial writes.  
- **Test Integrity:** All tests must pass cleanly, consistently, and idempotently.  
- **Observability:** Capture and log transient test failures for pattern tracing.

### Emerging Lore
> “True repair is not rebuilding — it’s teaching your tools to stop lying.”  
A2IA’s self-repair is not about recovering files, but restoring trust in execution.

---

### Next Focus
1. Gather pytest failure summaries (failing test names, traceback excerpts).  
2. Patch or rewrite nondeterministic file tools.  
3. Re-run full test suite until results stabilize at 100%.  
4. Update Chronicle and A2IA.md with stabilized results and tool documentation.
