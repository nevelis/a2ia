# A2IA Architecture and Development Log
This is the authoritative log for architecture, design, decisions, progress, and lessons learned within the **a2ia/** subsystem.

---

## Architecture Overview
The `a2ia` module defines the modular framework underpinning the systemâ€™s automation, workspace, and AI orchestration layers. Key components include:

- **Core**: foundational logic for workspace and app lifecycle management.
- **Client**: LLM and MCP client orchestrators handling communication.
- **Tools**: discrete capability modules providing CI/CD, filesystem, Git, memory, Terraform, and shell utilities.
- **Servers**: HTTP and REST interfaces exposing A2IA capabilities externally.
- **CLI**: interactive and automation-oriented command interfaces.

### Notable Submodules
| Path | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `a2ia/core.py` | Core workspace management and runtime services. |
| `a2ia/tools/filesystem_tools.py` | Workspace I/O interface; currently includes faulty append/truncate logic. |
| `a2ia/tools/git_sdlc_tools.py` | SDLC lifecycle management integrated with Git. |
| `a2ia/tools/memory_tools.py` | Persistent semantic and state memory management. |
| `a2ia/http_server.py` | Local HTTP interface to the workspace. |

## Development Notes
- **Priority Fixes**: The `filesystem_tools.append_file` currently rewrites entire files instead of appending safely; `truncate_file` opens files read-only (`'r+'`) without handling missing files.
- **Testing Protocol**: Use Test-Driven Development. Create failing tests first, confirm failures, then fix implementation.
- **Scope**: All work must remain confined to the `a2ia/` directory.
- **Safety**: Never use `EditFile` or `PatchFile`; prefer full read-modify-write.

## Recent Changes
**2025-10-25**
- Initialized internal A2IA.md documentation and project logs for subsystem.
- Conducted inspection of `a2ia/tools/filesystem_tools.py`.
- Prepared Chronicle and Continuum for tracking subsystem development state.
- Verified recursive workspace structure integrity.

**Next Steps:**
1. Create failing tests for `append_file` and `truncate_file`.
2. Confirm observed faulty behavior.
3. Implement safe append/truncate logic.
4. Validate through test suite execution.
5. Update Chronicle and Continuum accordingly.
